Punchline
:::::::::

What worried me recently
++++++++++++++++++++++++

There aren't enough jokes on the web. I'd like to see more satire. Urgently.

There is indeed, on the web a lot of poetry. But poetry web sites are not poetic places. Or even happy spaces.

Also the traditions of personal web sites, `web rings`_, and `web feeds`_ are no longer common practice.
And I felt sad about that.

What I did about it
+++++++++++++++++++

I wrote *Punchline*.

Punchline is a static blogging framework. It treats your words as speech, and delivers them as dialogue with
measured timing. It supports multimedia too.

Punchline was designed from the ground up to generate `JSON Feed`_. So you can publish your blog as a feed
under the topics you choose.

Usage
+++++

:code:`punchline [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--output OUTPUT] inputs [inputs ...]`

  *inputs*         One or more search paths.

  -h, --help       Show a help message and exit.
  --config CONFIG  Specify a site configuration file.
  --output OUTPUT  Set directory for output.

There is full `documentation online`_.
