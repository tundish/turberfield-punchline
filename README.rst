Punchline
:::::::::

What I worried about this year
==============================

There aren't enough jokes on the web. And there may never be. Never ever could ever be.

There is indeed on the web a lot of poetry, but poetry web sites are not poetic places. Or even happy spaces.

Oh, and the traditions of personal web sites, `web rings`_, and news feeds have fallen from common practice.

What I did about it
===================

I wrote *Punchline*.

Punchline is a static blogging framework.

Punchline was designed from the ground up to supprt `JSON Feed`_.
