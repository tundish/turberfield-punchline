Punchline
:::::::::

What worried me recently
========================

There aren't enough jokes on the web. We need more satire. Urgently.

There is indeed on the web a lot of poetry, but poetry web sites are not poetic places. Or even happy spaces.

And the traditions of personal web sites, `web rings`_, and `web feeds`_ are no longer common practice.

What I did about it
===================

I wrote *Punchline*.

Punchline is a static blogging framework.

Punchline was designed from the ground up to supprt `JSON Feed`_.
